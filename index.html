									<h1>What we're all about</h1>
									<p>California Club Tennis is a student-run organization that practices and competes throughout the school year. The club is a part of UC Berkeley's Rec Sports Clubs, playing in USTA Tennis On Campus Tournaments. We use World Team Tennis rules in match play, which emphasizes both singles and doubles play. During the fall, we compete against Northern California teams at schools such as Stanford, UC Davis and Sac State. In the spring the team travels to invitational tournaments playing against the best teams across the nation.</p>
									<img id = "holi" src="images/holi.jpg">
									<p>Our team provides more than just a competitive option for students to continue improving their tennis at UC Berkeley. We also are involved within the community and hold socials to get to know each other off the court as well. As members of the Cal Club Tennis team, we strive to be the best on and off the court.</p>

										<p>Hi guys! This is Joel Garcia and Diane Ji, your Cal Club Tennis captains for the 2014-2015 season. We both have been on the team since our freshman year and love that club tennis is more than playing tennis; many of our cherished memories at Berkeley are those that we have shared with our fellow teammates. As captains of the team, we both consider our position on the team to be an honor. We can't wait to meet all the great players trying out this fall and we're excited for the year we have ahead of us!</p>

										<input id = "Q1" name="question-1" type="checkbox">
										<label for="Q1">When and where are tryouts?</label>
										<article class = "small">
											<p>Our annual tryout tournament is usually held on a weekend in early September. Make sure to stop by our booth at Caltopia and check our calendar (under "Events") for updates!</p>
										</article>
									</div>
									<div>
										<input id = "Q2" name = "question-2" type="checkbox"/>
										<label for = "Q2">How many people are allowed on the team?</label>
										<article class = "small">
											<p>There is no minimum or maximum number, and it varies from year to year. We take individuals based off of their overall fit with the team as well as talent level, so there are no limitations.</p>
									</div>	
									
									<div>
										<input id = "Q3" name="question-3" type="checkbox"/>
										<label for = "Q3">How much time will I have to commit to the team?</label>
										<article class = "large">
											<p>Club Tennis is all about putting in as much as you want to get out of it! Many activities are voluntary and flexible. We understand that your first priority is school, and our captains are lenient to scheduling conflicts. We have set practices twice (and sometimes three times) a week on Tuesday and Thursday nights, either 5-7pm or 6-8pm once daylight savings time starts. <span style = "font-weight: 500">However, it is important to note that our captains are constantly evaluating the contributions each individual makes to the team.</span> Also, regional and national tournaments require participants to have played a minimum amount of previous tournaments to qualify, so please keep that in mind.</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<input id = "Q4" name = "question-4" type="checkbox"/>
										<label for = "Q4">How do tournaments work?</label>
										<article class = "medium">
											<p>Most tournaments are one-day, all-day events that occur roughly once a month. Larger tournaments, including regionals or nationals will be multi-day. The club travels as a team. Scoring is in traditional world team tennis format. This means no-ad games, sudden death set tiebreakers, and changeovers after every 4 games. A complete list of the rules can be found <a style = "color: #1D4E8D; font-weight: 500" href="http://www.wtt.com/MediaCenter/2008%20WTT%20Rules%20Guide.pdf" >here</a>.</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<input id = "Q5" name="question-5" type="checkbox"/>
										<label for = "Q5">I didn't make the team! What now?</label>
										<article class = "medium">
											<p>Don't worry! There will always be the next year to try out. Each year we have a huge number of crazy talented people come out, which means our decision is always extremely tough.</p>

											<p>In the meantime, you should definitely consider joining Cal's intramural tennis club, Tennis at Cal. It's a great group of people for all levels of tennis who just love to play. In fact, there are several people on the Cal Club Tennis team who are also on Tennis at Cal. </p>
